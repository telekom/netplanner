# Example interfaces file for sriov-netplan-shim
#
# When the optional `match` dictionary is present and contains a `macaddress`
# or `pciaddress` field, these fields will be used to locate the device rather
# than the interface name. This is useful on systems where interface names are
# unpredictable or changing names early in the boot sequence.
