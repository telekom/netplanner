# netplanner

## Description

Netplanner implements the top-down datacenter approach for IP and Network Interface Management.
It plans the network on the host by using `systemd-networkd` as the underlying network configuration provider.

It refuses to implement L2 capabilities such as DHCP.

It also implements interfaces which are needed for L3 capabilities such as `Veth` and `Dummy` interface types.

It is open to be extended with other providers which have a different text-based input.
